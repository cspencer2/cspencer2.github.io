              <h1>Major</h1>
              <h2>Bachelor of Arts in Technical Communications</h2>
              <p>I am a Technical Communications major, and will be earning a minor in Graphic Design. I enjoy the wide range of skills necessary in my chosen major to include -- tech writing and editing, grant and proposal writing, graphic design, public relations, and the technology behind the various forms of today&#39;s publishing from paper to pixels.</p>

              <h2>Background Information: where I&#39;ve been, what I&#39;ve done</h2>

              <p>I am a former auto mechanic with thirty years experience. For twenty-five of those years I was a certified ASE Master Technician, and worked on foreign and domestic cars and light trucks. I was involved in all phases of auto repair, but spent the largest portion of my career in electrical diagnosis.</p>
            
              <p>I have been a heavy reader since I was thirteen years old, reading 2 to 3 books a month. When I multiply 2 to 3 books a month by forty years, I come to the realization that I have read nearly one thousand books. This reading across all subject matters ingrained in me the ability to write, which is why I am pursuing a career that involves writing. Being  artistic, as in painting and drawing, I am also attracted to graphic design and enjoy computer aided design projects.</p>

              <p>To practice writing to an audience, I started a <a href="http://master-link.newsvine.com/">blog</a> about two years ago and have written approximately 120 articles. My blog is fairly active, and I have many readers that are drawn to my articles that comment about my material. This activity has been a great learning experience, and lets me know if my audience is comprehending the material I am publishing.</p>

              <h1>Professional Objectives</h1>
              <p>I wish to pursue a career where I all my abilities in writing, technology, graphic design, and my public relations skills can be utilized to the benefit of my employer to my career satisfaction. I enjoy writing and hope to someday publish creative general interest fiction books and novels, with an office on the beach.</p>
